## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Install the 2025 WPILib VS Code environment:
1. Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html).
2. Download `WPILib_Windows-2025.2.1.ISO`.
3. Right-click the ISO file and select "Mount" as a disk.
4. Run `D:\WPILibInstaller.exe`.
5. Install for all users and download for this computer only.
6. After completing the installation, eject the ISO by right-clicking the `D:` drive and selecting "Eject."

### Setting Up the Project

1. Open 2025 WPILib VS Code.
2. Fork a copy of the main repository in GitHub
   - Go to https://github.com/rrmcmurry/2025FrisbeeBot
   - Click on the button that says Fork in the upper right corner
   - This should make a copy of 2025FrisbeeBot in your own GitHub account.
3. Clone your forked GitHub repository locally in VS Code:
   - On the Welcome Tab under "Start" look for "Clone Git Repository" and select it
   - https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/2025FrisbeeBot.git
4. Verify the setup:
   - Check for "Build Successful" in the Terminal.
5. Navigate to the project files:   
   - `*/src/main/java/frc/robot`
   - Focus on modifying `RobotContainer.java`, and any files under `subsystems`.
6. Create a branch
   - If you plan to make changes and want those changes merged back into the original project, I recommend you make a branch with your name on it.
   - Make changes in that branch

### Workflow 

- **Fetch upstream and merge** 
  - Fetch updates from the main repository before you begin coding 
- **Code & Test:** 
  - Ensure your project compiles and builds successfully before pushing changes
- **Commit** 
  - Use the VS Code Source control area to commit and push your changes back to your own GitHub repository.
- **Pull Requests:**
  - Create a Pull Request when you want me to pull your changes into the main repository
